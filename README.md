# DeepLearning_ColonPolypDetection
Consists of Deep Learning models such as PSPNet, SegNet, and Unet combined with VGG-16, Effinet,for “Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models on Segmentation of Colorectal Polyps”, to find the presence of polyps in the colorectal region. The methods are compared with one another using DICE and IOU scores and the best method is used to perform ensemble learning to make the model function much more efficiently.
